% Template Matching is a general purpose method usually used for object
% recognition. A template is created for the sought object and an image is scanned
% with the template, calculating a matching cost for each possible position.

% Naively applying template matching to the barcode reading problem would not
% yield an interesting algorithm, because after choosing a scanline, reading is
% reduced to finding a barcode such that the 

Our reading method is taken from \cite{Gallo2011} and is based on matching
deformable templates to a 1D scanline obtained from the localization and
boundary detection steps.
